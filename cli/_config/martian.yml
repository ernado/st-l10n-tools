# Simplified translation parts.
# If simplified, the "msgid" value of translation is set to simplified
# relative path of translated element, not the original text.
#
# Like for Reagents/RecordReagent with Key=Flour, the id for Unit will be "Flour.Unit"
# instead of "g".
#
# The "Tips" part is always assumed as non-simplified.
simplified:
  - Reagents.Unit
  - Keys
